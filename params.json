{"name":"Djembe","body":"DJEMBE\r\nA django based torrent tracker and frontend extended by plugins for different applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracker:\r\nOperates identically to conventional trackers, just implemented in python. View\r\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker for more information. Based on\r\n protocal defined: http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tracker uses a database of peers to log which users are downloading which\r\n torrents and the progress attributed to said torrents.\r\nEach torrent is dynamically generated with an announce URL which includes the\r\n users private key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlugins:\r\nEach plugin defines one model that has a one-to-one relationship with a torrent.\r\n These act as the 'atomic' unit of each plugin. These atomic units are grouped\r\n together in increasingly complex ways to organize torrents in whatever way\r\n makes sense for the given plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n Music\r\n\r\n  The top level model in Music is Artist. Each artist (or group of artist)\r\n   has a number of Albums, and each Album can have a number of Album Release\r\n   each having a number of Release Formats, the atomic unit for this plugin.\r\n   The general flow and UI is based off of what.cd\r\n\r\n\r\n Movies\r\n\r\n  This plugin operates similarly to above: People > Movie > Edition > Movie Format\r\n   (The relationship between Movie and People is split into four categories: Actors,\r\n   Producers, Writers, and Directors where Actors have an additional property relating\r\n   them to the movie, which is the Role).\r\n\r\n Backup\r\n\r\n  The top level is the Backup User > Backup > Version. The Backup User requires a\r\n   special kind of UserProfile because of a number of special cases regarding ratio.\r\n  The Backup plugin is intended to create a platform for users to trade unused\r\n   harddrive space for offsite backup and redundancy. The rules governing the ratio\r\n   are as follows:\r\n\r\n    -Users have to backup other users content as much as they want their content\r\n     backed up. For example, if a User wants to back up a 1GB file with 5x redundancy\r\n     they will need to download a total of 5GB of other users content.\r\n\r\n    -A priority system is associated with torrents that have not yet reached their\r\n     desired redundancy.\r\n\r\n    -Each User of the site has a number of priority points that they can use to\r\n     incentivize users to backup their content. Priority points are assigned to\r\n     backups as a whole. Each version inherits the priority points of its parent.","tagline":"Tracker frontend","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
